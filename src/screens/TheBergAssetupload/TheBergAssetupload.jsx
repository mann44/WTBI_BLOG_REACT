                        Frito-Lay provided me with fantastic opportunities to
                        grow my career and provided me with different
                        experiences. I am the proud father of 5, who reside in
                        North Carolina. I have been in Texas for three and a
                        half years (3 years in San Antonio and the last 6 months
                        in Houston). I started at Frito Lay as an experience

                        As we prepare to close Q1, it has been a challenging
                        quarter from a Food Safety and Cost standpoint. As
                        shared previously, our site priorities are: Personal
                        Safety, Food Safety, and then Everything Else. Let’s
                        lean heavily into these priorities as we close P3 to
                        ensure a successful Q2. <br />
                        <br />
                        There are areas of improvement that we can leverage as a
                        springboard forward: Continued Safety Excellence,
                        site-wide improvement, and Labor performance in the
                        WHSE. We have the people and talent to be an Award of
                        Excellence-winning site, and it takes all of us moving
                        forward together to make it happen.

                  Frito-Lay provided me with fantastic opportunities to grow my
                  career and provided me with different experiences. I am the
                  proud father of 5, who reside in North Carolina. I have been
                  in Texas for three and a half years (3 years in San Antonio
                  and the last 6 months in Houston). I started at Frito Lay as
                  an experience hire in Jonesboro, Arkansas. <br />

                  As we prepare to close Q1, it has been a challenging quarter
                  from a Food Safety and Cost standpoint. As shared previously,
                  our site priorities are: Personal Safety, Food Safety, and
                  then Everything Else. Let’s lean heavily into these priorities
                  as we close P3 to ensure a successful Q2. <br />
                  <br />
                  There are areas of improvement that we can leverage as a
                  springboard forward: Continued Safety Excellence, site-wide
                  improvement, and Labor performance in the WHSE. We have the
                  people and talent to be an Award of Excellence-winning site,

                    Frito-Lay provided me with fantastic opportunities to grow
                    my career and provided me with different experiences. I am

                    been in Texas for three and a half years (3 years in San
                    Antonio and the last 6 months in Houston). I started at

                    As we prepare to close Q1, it has been a challenging quarter
                    from a Food Safety and Cost standpoint. As shared
                    previously, our site priorities are: Personal Safety, Food
                    Safety, and then Everything Else. Let’s lean heavily into
                    these priorities as we close P3 to ensure a successful Q2.{" "}

                    There are areas of improvement that we can leverage as a
                    springboard forward: Continued Safety Excellence, site-wide
                    improvement, and Labor performance in the WHSE. We have the
                    people and talent to be an Award of Excellence-winning site,
                    and it takes all of us moving forward together to make it
                    happen.
